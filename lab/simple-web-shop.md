## Objective

In this exercise, you will design and implement a simple Web shop. Your web
shop must be able to manage and display products, customers, and order
information.

## Requirements

1. **Product Management**:

   - The web shop must be able to display a list of available products.
   - It should be possible to add new products and remove existing products.
   - Each product should include at least the following information: name,
     description, price.

2. **Customer Management**:

   - The system must support customer accounts, allowing customers to register,
     log in, and update their personal information.
   - Each customer should have at least the following attributes: name, email,
     address, and purchase history.

3. **Order Processing**:
   - Customers must be able to create new orders by adding products to a
     orders and checking out.
   - Each order should store information about the customer, the products
     purchased, quantities, total price, and order status (e.g., pending,
     shipped, completed).

## Additional Considerations

- The implementation is open to your design choices. You can decide on the
  technology stack, how you will store data, and how to structure the interaction
  between customers, products, and orders.
- Focus on simplicity and functionality. The user interface can be minimal, as
  long as the core features work as intended.

Prepare to discuss your design decisions.
