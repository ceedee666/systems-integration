## Overview

This lecture covers the four fundamental integration styles based on [Chapter 2
of _Enterprise Integration
Patterns_](https://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321200686/samplepages/0321200683.pdf)
by Gregor Hohpe. The goal of this session is to deepen your understanding of
the different approaches to system integration, their pros and cons, and how
they relate to the interoperability levels discussed in the Motivation lecture.

As discussed in the motivation, the first perspective on integration involves
the different integration styles. Four basic integration styles are identified:

1. File Transfer
2. Shared Database
3. Remote Procedure Invocation (RPC)
4. Messaging

Each of these styles presents a unique approach to solving the integration
challenges in enterprise systems. In this session, you will work in groups to
explore these styles in depth.

## Exercise: Analysing Integration Styles

Download [Chapter 2 available
online](https://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321200686/samplepages/0321200683.pdf)
of _Enterprise Integration Patterns_. Form small groups of 3-4 students. Each
group will focus on one of the four integration styles. Your task is to explore
the following aspects of your assigned style:

1. Definition: What is this integration style, and how does it work?
2. Key Characteristics: What are the primary features of this style (e.g.,
   synchronous vs. asynchronous communication, data centralization)?
3. Pros & Cons: What are the strengths and weaknesses of this style in terms of
   scalability, performance, and reliability?
4. Relation to integration levels: How does this style connect to the
   syntactic, semantic, and organizational levels of interoperability?
5. Relation to integration scenarios and methods: How does this style relate to
   different integration scenarios and methods?
6. Scenarios: Apply this style to the small-to-medium-sized company from
   Exercise 1 in the Motivation lecture. Would this style be effective for
   synchronizing stock information between an ERP system and a web shop?

Prepare 1-2 slides summarizing your key findings. You have 30 minutes for this
exercise.
