# Reliability and performance

## Side note: Understanding computer time on a human scale

In modern computing, operations happen incredibly fast, often measured in
nanoseconds (ns), microseconds (¬µs), or milliseconds (ms). While intervals
measured in these units may all seem very short, understanding their
differences is critical when designing and optimizing system integrations. A
seemingly small delay at the computer scale can accumulate into significant
slowdowns, especially when systems process a large number of messages per
second.

To better understand the performance impact of various operations, we can
translate these computer times into a human scale. By scaling up the times,
we can relate them to durations we experience in everyday life, making it
easier to comprehend the relative speed of different components in a system.

In the following exercise, you will explore how common computer operations ‚Äî
such as accessing memory, performing disk I/O, or making network calls ‚Äî
translate to a human time scale. This will provide insights into the vast
differences in speed across system components and help you appreciate the
importance of efficient integration design.

### Exercise: Scaling computer times to human scale

In this exercise, you will calculate how much time common computer operations
would take if scaled to human scale. Use the following conversion:

- 0,5 ns (nanosecond) = 1 second on the human scale.

For each operation listed below, calculate the equivalent human time. Round the
results to whole numbers for simplicity.

| Operation                       | Computer time | Human scale |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| CPU cycle                       | 0,5 ns        |             |
| Level 1 cache access            | 1 ns          |             |
| Level 2 cache access            | 3 ns          |             |
| Level 3 cache access            | 28 ns         |             |
| Main memory access (DDR DIMM)   | 100 ns        |             |
| SSD I/O                         | 100 ¬µs        |             |
| Rotational disk I/O             | 1 ms          |             |
| Internet call (SF to NYC)       | 65 ms         |             |
| Internet call (SF to Hong Kong) | 141 ms        |             |

## Fault tolerance

Once multiple systems are connected using some integration technology, the
entire system landscape is inevitably transformed into a distributed system.
Unlike standalone systems, distributed systems involve components that operate
on separate nodes and communicate over networks. While this distributed nature
brings flexibility and enables scalability, it also introduces a higher degree
of complexity and vulnerability to failures. In this section fault tolerance
for distributed systems is discussed in detail.

Fault tolerance is a term closely related to dependability. In the context of distributed systems dependability includes the following concepts [^1]:

- Availability
- Reliability
- Safety
- Maintainability

### Availability

> **Definition**
>
> Availability is the probability that a system is operational and accessible at
> a given point in time. It reflects the system's readiness to deliver its
> intended functionality whenever required.Key considerations:

Availability is typically expressed as a percentage, calculated using the formula:

```math
$$
Availability = \frac{Uptime}{Uptime + Downtime} \times 100
$$
```

Availability=UptimeUptime+Downtime√ó100
Availability=Uptime+DowntimeUptime‚Äã√ó100

For example:

    A system with 99.9% availability (commonly known as "three nines") allows for approximately 8.76 hours of downtime per year.
    A system with 99.99% availability ("four nines") reduces downtime to around 52.6 minutes per year.

- Redundancy: Use of failover mechanisms or redundant components to minimize
  downtime.
- Monitoring: Real-time detection and response to issues.
- Load balancing: Distributing requests across multiple servers to prevent
  overloading.

Example in integration: An e-commerce platform must ensure its payment gateway
remains available during high traffic events like Black Friday.

### Reliability

Definition: Reliability measures the ability of a system to perform its
intended function without failure over a specific period. It focuses on
consistent operation rather than immediate recovery.

Key considerations:

- Error handling: Mechanisms to detect and address errors without compromising
  the system.
- Data integrity: Ensuring data remains accurate and consistent across
  integrations.
- Testing: Regular stress testing to identify potential weaknesses.

Example in integration: A supply chain system must reliably synchronize
inventory data across warehouses and stores.

---

### Safety

Definition: Safety ensures that a system operates without causing unacceptable
risks or harm. This is particularly crucial in domains like healthcare or
aviation.

Key considerations:

- Fail-safe mechanisms: Designing systems to enter a safe state in case of
  failure.
- Error isolation: Ensuring faults in one component do not propagate to others.
- Compliance: Adhering to industry standards and regulations.

Example in integration: A healthcare system must prevent incorrect medication
dosages due to integration errors between prescription and dispensing systems.

---

### Maintainability

Definition: Maintainability is the ease with which a system can be repaired or
updated to restore functionality or improve performance.

Key considerations:

- Modular design: Simplifying updates and replacements by isolating components.
- Documentation: Providing detailed records of system configurations and
  integrations.
- Monitoring tools: Enabling quick diagnosis of issues through effective
  monitoring.

Example in integration: A content management system (CMS) should allow seamless
integration with new plugins or APIs without major rework.

---

Interactive Discussion:

- Discuss real-world examples where each aspect is critical.
- Highlight trade-offs: For instance, achieving high availability might
  increase complexity, impacting maintainability.

By covering these aspects, students can understand the multi-dimensional
approach required to design robust and fault-tolerant integrations.
